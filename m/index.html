<h1 id="before-there-was-time">Before There Was Time</h1>

<p>Before there was time<br/>
There were visions in Your mind<br/>
There was death in the fall of mankind<br/>
But there was life in salvation's design</p>

<p>Before there were days<br/>
There were nights I could not see Your face<br/>
But the night could not keep me from grace<br/>
When You came and took my place</p>

<p><strong>So I cry holy only begotten Son of God<br/>
Ancient of days<br/>
I cry holy only begotten Son of God<br/>
And sing the praises<br/>
Of the One who saved me<br/>
And the promises He made</strong></p>

<p>Before there was time<br/>
You counted the hairs on my head<br/>
You knew all the words I've said<br/>
And You purchased me back from the dead</p>

<p>Before I was made<br/>
You searched me and knew my ways<br/>
You numbered all my days<br/>
And You set forth the steps I would take</p>

<h1 id="he-who-feeds-the-ravens">He Who Feeds The Ravens</h1>

<p>Sometimes a light surprises<br/>
the Christian while he sings;<br/>
It is the Lord, who rises<br/>
with healing in His wings:<br/>
When comforts are declining,<br/>
He grants the soul again<br/>
A season of clear shining, <br/>
to cheer it after the rain.</p>

<p>In holy contemplation <br/>
we sweetly can pursue<br/>
The theme of God's salvation, <br/>
and find it ever new.<br/>
Set free from present sorrow, <br/>
we cheerfully can say,<br/>
Let the unknown 'morrow 
<br/>bring with it what it may.</p>

<p><strong>It can bring with it nothing <br/>
but He will bear us through;<br/>
Who gives the lilies clothing <br/>
will clothe His people, too;<br/>
Beneath the spreading heavens, <br/>
no creature but is fed;<br/>
And He Who feeds the ravens <br/>
will give His children bread.</strong></p>

<h1 id="ruin-me">Ruin Me</h1>

<p>Woe to me I am unclean<br/>
A sinner found in Your presence<br/> 
I see you seated on Your throne <br/>
Exalted, Your Glory surrounds You </p>
 
<p><em>Now the plans that I have made<br/>
Fail to compare when I see Your glory</em></p>

<p><strong>Ruin my life the plans that I've made<br/>
Ruin desires for my own selfish gain<br/>
Destroy the idols that have taken Your place<br/>
'Til its You alone I live for,<br/>
You alone I live for.</strong></p>
 
<p><em>Holy, Holy is the Lord Almighty!
Holy is the Lord!</em></p>

<h1 id="what-a-friend-we-have-in-jesus">What a Friend We Have in Jesus</h1>

<p>What a Friend we have in Jesus,<br/>
all our sins and griefs to bear!<br/>
What a privilege to carry <br/>
everything to God in prayer!<br/>
O what peace we often forfeit, <br/>
O what needless pain we bear,<br/>
All because we do not carry <br/>
everything to God in prayer.</p>

<p>Have we trials and temptations? <br/>
Is there trouble anywhere?<br/>
We should never be discouraged;<br/> 
take it to the Lord in prayer.<br/>
Can we find a friend so faithful <br/>
who will all our sorrows share?<br/>
Jesus knows our every weakness; <br/>
take it to the Lord in prayer.</p>

<p>Are we weak and heavy laden, <br/>
cumbered with a load of care?<br/>
Precious Savior, still our refuge,<br/> 
take it to the Lord in prayer.<br/>
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?<br/> 
Take it to the Lord in prayer!<br/>
In His arms He&rsquo;ll take and shield thee; <br/>
thou wilt find a solace there.</p>

<p>Blessed Savior, Thou hast promised <br/>
Thou wilt all our burdens bear<br/>
May we ever, Lord, be bringing <br/>
all to Thee in earnest prayer.<br/>
Soon in glory bright unclouded <br/>
there will be no need for prayer<br/>
Rapture, praise and endless worship <br/>
will be our sweet portion there.</p>

<h1 id="you-bled">You Bled</h1>

<p>You bled your heart out<br/>
Now I feel love beat in my chest<br/>
How Wonderful<br/>
You gave your beauty<br/>
In exchange for my ugliness, <br/>
How Wonderful</p>

<p><em>You left your perfection<br/>
And took on our rejection</em></p>

<p><strong>Oh, How Marvelous<br/>
How Boundless<br/>
Is your love<br/>
Is your Love<br/>
How Wonderful<br/>
Sacrificial<br/>
Is your Love for me</strong></p>

<p>You put on our chains<br/>
Sent us out through the open door<br/>
How Wonderful<br/>
You took our sadness<br/>
Crowned us with joy and real peace<br/>
How Wonderful</p>

<p><em>You left your perfection<br/>
and fought for our redemption</em><br/>

<p><strong>Oh How Marvelous<br/>
How Boundless<br/>
Is your love<br/>
Is your Love<br/>
How Wonderful<br/>
Sacrificial<br/>
Is your Love for me</strong></p>

<p><em>Yes Jesus loves me<br/>
Yes Jesus loves me, How Wonderful<br/>
Yes Jesus loves me<br/>
This is love<br/>
You gave yourself</em></p>
